            <h1>Pope Francis Bingo</h1>
            <p>
                Are you disturbed by the things that Pope Francis says or does? Do you find that when you try to point them out to your fellow Catholics that you are met with
                such feeble comebacks as "are you holier than the Pope?" Well you're not alone. Pope Francis Bingo was founded based on all sorts of various excuses Catholics have
                received since March 13, 2013.
            </p>
            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <p>
                Simple. You can either print out your card or open up as many tabs as you'd like and simply click on the square once you hear someone use that particular excuse.
                When you get 5 in a row, you have yourself a BINGO!
